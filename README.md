# Lab-4
Computer Architecture Lab Assignment

For this lab, I created an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) as a part of a CPU which can implement several instructions. These include arithmetic addition, logic bitwise xor, logic bitwise and, logic bitwise or, logic bitwise nor, register right logic shift, and register left logic shift.

An arithmetic logic unit is a critical part of a CPU. This is what performs arithmetic operations on data stored in memory. Because the purpose of a CPU is to manipulate data in a useful way, having these basic functions is crucial for functionality. My ALU has 7 basic functions which should be enough to demonstrate the concept of an ALU.
